# GA-JS-React-Node-Project-Front-End

## Project:

### Technical Requirements
- Backend: connects provides a API for React front end by performing CRUD operations on MongoDB using Mongoose package 
- Frontend: Uses routes to display various React components, provides CRUD functions through forms and querying backend API.

### Express
- API Crud endpoints interacting with minimum 1 model
- Endpoints use expected HTTP methods
- GET, POST, PUT, DELETE

### Mongoose & MongoDB
- minimum 1 mongoose model

### React
- One parent component controlling one or more child components
- Provides CRUD operations through forms
- CRUD operations query backend (which in turn updates the database) for persistence
- Makes use of routes where appropriate

## Run Instructions
- enter /ndis-search/ folder
- npm install
- npm run


## Issues I ran into
- Setting up backend was initially hard to remember
- I didn't spend enough time thinking through the components I'd create for the forms so ended up creating a bunch of files which weren't required
- Got confused between front end and back end routes
- 

## Improvements for the future
- Need to find a better way of adding services to the database from the forms
- Make code more DRY
- Refactor the callbacks as promises
- U/I improvements to make it look like existing Karista website
